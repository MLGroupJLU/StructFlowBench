This leads to increased sea levels as more meltwater enters the oceans from glaciers and ice sheets. The loss of sea ice and glaciers also results in the reduction of habitat for various species such as polar bears and seals. Moreover, the influx of fresh water alters ocean currents and weather patterns. The diminishing ice cover further contributes to global warming by reducing the Earth's albedo, which is its ability to reflect sunlight.",

It began with Gregorian chants in the 9th century and evolved significantly over time. Key characteristics that define classical music include its use of formal structures, such as sonata and concerto forms, and the emphasis on orchestration. It flourished during the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern eras, each bringing unique styles and innovations. Renowned figures include Johann Sebastian Bach, whose compositions are a testament to Baroque complexity; Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, celebrated for his operas and concertos during the Classical period; Ludwig van Beethoven, who bridged Classical and Romantic styles; and Igor Stravinsky, a notable figure in modernism. Classical music is also known for its expressive depth and technical precision.",
