As a social media expert might say, people are now more connected than ever, allowing us to maintain friendships across distances and cultures through apps like Instagram or Snapchat. However, it's also changed the depth of interactions—people sometimes prefer texting over phone calls, leading to shorter, less personal conversations. The instant and global reach of platforms like Twitter lets us participate in conversations worldwide, but it can also lead to miscommunication due to a lack of non-verbal cues."
