Climate change affects biodiversity by altering habitats, causing species migration, and increasing extinction rates due to temperature rise, changes in precipitation, and extreme weather events. For instance, warming seas lead to coral bleaching, affecting marine life, while shifts in temperature zones force animals and plants to migrate, disrupting ecosystems. An example is the polar bears losing their ice habitats due to melting Arctic ice, impacting their hunting and survival."

Ocean acidification, caused by increased CO2 absorption, harms shell-forming sea creatures and disrupts food chains. For example, the acidification weakens coral reefs' calcium carbonate structures, critical habitats for numerous marine species, leading to biodiversity loss."
