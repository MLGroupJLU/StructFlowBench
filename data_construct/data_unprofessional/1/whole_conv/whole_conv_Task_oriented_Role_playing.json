First, it's important to set aside some money as an emergency fund, maybe about 3-6 months of your living expenses. Next, consider investing in a diversified portfolio, like index funds or ETFs. These are collections of stocks or bonds that are managed for you, making them a good start if you're new to investing. Over time, they can help your money grow without needing lots of your attention."

If one fruit goes bad, you’ve got lots of others still good. So your money is safe and can grow with less risk."

Ditch plastic straws and cutlery in favor of metal or glass alternatives. Buy in bulk to reduce packaging waste, and opt for products with minimal or no plastic packaging. You could also try DIY household cleaners to avoid buying plastic bottles. Composting's another way to cut down on plastic-lined food wrappers. Hope this helps!"
